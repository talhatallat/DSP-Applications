## Objectives
The objective of the Lab project is to implement an audio effects system using the Python and Pspice environment. Both Python and Pspice have become industry standard packagesbeing used by a wide variety of engineers, scientists and mathematicians. The audio effects 
system should provide various options including:

* Load in a wav file/Plot/Play File, Decimate to reduce data overhead

* Basic Delay, Multiple Delays using IIR Filters
